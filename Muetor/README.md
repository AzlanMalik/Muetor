This is very simple project and it utilizes onle Plain CSS, HTML and a little javascript.

You can run this very simply on your machine by just cloning the project and executing the index.html file.

The main highlight of this project is its CSS. Which i have designed in very neat manner so it could be easily changed or mantained by anyone so if you like my design feel free to use the project as you like.
